# 4.13 LAB - Implement supertype and subtype entities (Sakila)

Similar entities have many common attributes and relationships. Similar entities are often converted into subtypes of a supertype entity, as illustrated in this lab.

In the Sakila database, the customer and staff tables have several common columns. Convert these tables into subtypes of person. Specifically, write CREATE TABLE statements for person, customer, and staff that implement this ER diagram:

![EX413](https://github.com/teopinillo/D-427-WGU-data-Applications/assets/18202193/e7aa6aed-ca0c-4b9d-8108-a27f46f2c120)

Follow Sakila conventions for table and column names:

* All lower case
* Underscore separator between root and suffix
* Foreign keys have the same name as referenced primary key

Implement attributes as columns:

* All columns are NOT NULL.
* The primary key of all three tables is person_id with data type SMALLINT UNSIGNED.
* The last_update and create_date columns have data type TIMESTAMP.
* The picture column has data type BLOB.
* All other columns have data type VARCHAR(20).

Implement the belongs_to and works_at relationships as foreign keys:

* belongs_to becomes an address_id foreign key in person with data type SMALLINT UNSIGNED.
* works_at becomes a store_id foreign key in staff with data type TINYINT UNSIGNED.
* Specify RESTRICT actions for both foreign keys.

Subtype entities have an IsA relationship to the supertype. Implement these relationships as foreign keys:

* The person_id columns of customer and staff become foreign keys referring to person.
* Specify CASCADE actions for both foreign keys.

NOTE: If you execute your solution with the Sakila database, you must first drop customer, staff, and all constraints that refer to these tables. Use the following statements with Sakila only, not in the zyLab environment:


	ALTER TABLE payment 
		DROP CONSTRAINT fk_payment_customer,
		DROP CONSTRAINT fk_payment_staff;
	ALTER TABLE rental 
		DROP CONSTRAINT fk_rental_customer,
		DROP CONSTRAINT fk_rental_staff; 
	ALTER TABLE store
		DROP CONSTRAINT fk_store_staff;
		DROP TABLE customer, staff;

## Solution:

	CREATE TABLE person (
	 person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,
	 first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 last_name  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 email  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 address_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	 active  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 last_update TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, 
	 FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(address_id)
	  ON DELETE RESTRICT
	  ON UPDATE RESTRICT
	 );
	 
	CREATE TABLE staff (
	 person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	 picture BLOB NOT NULL,
	 username  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 password  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	 store_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	 FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(person_id)
	 ON DELETE CASCADE
	 ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	 FOREIGN KEY (store_id) REFERENCES store(store_id)
	  ON DELETE RESTRICT
	  ON UPDATE RESTRICT
	 );
	 
	CREATE TABLE customer (
	 person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	 create_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	 FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(person_id)
	  ON DELETE CASCADE
	  ON UPDATE CASCADE
	 );
