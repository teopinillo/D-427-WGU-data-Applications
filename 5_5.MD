# 5.5 LAB - Create index and explain (Sakila)

/*If you try this lab in MySQL Workbench, drop the index idx_title from film prior to executing statement 1.*/

	DROP INDEX idx_title ON film;

	/*step 1*/
	EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE title = 'ALONE TRIP';

	/*step 2*/
	CREATE INDEX idx_title ON film(title);

	/*step 3*/
	EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE title = 'ALONE TRIP';
	
	/* Step 4*/
	EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM film WHERE title > 'ALONE TRIP';

	/* STEP 5 */
	EXPLAIN SELECT rating, count(*) FROM film GROUP BY rating;
	/*column key is null, indicating no index is available for the query.
	Column rows is 100, indicating all rows are read. 
	The query executes a table scan and is slow.*/

	/* STEP 6 
	Create an index idx_rating on the rating column. */
	CREATE INDEX idx_rating ON film(rating);

	/* STEP 7
	Explain the query again*/
	EXPLAIN SELECT rating, count(*) FROM film GROUP BY rating;
	/* In the EXPLAIN result, column key has value idx_rating, 
	indicating the query reads rating values from the index. 
	The query uses an index scan, which is faster than a table scan (step 5). */
